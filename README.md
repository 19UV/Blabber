*AP World History - Dadaism Assignment*

For this assignment, I took the first 30 Articles from the Treaty of Versailles, and ran them through a Markov Chain generator. This serves to generate entirely new paragraphs from the treaty, but they serve to have no meaning. This both reflects the objectives of Dadaism, and serves to show Germany's thoughts of the treaty. Not ever German was in support of the Nazi movement, and not every German should have been punished, so the treaty was a bunch of pointless babbling.

## Building & Running
The Markov chain is stored in the output html file, which means that you need to build everything first. The following will do so
```bash
git clone https://github.com/19UV/Blabber.git

py generate.py

# Open template.html in your choice of a web browser
# This will also output output.json, which contains all the Markov Chain data.
```
